# Browser Base Clipboard
 This is a browser based clipboard tool made with html, css and javascript used to store text documents in a place. 

 
Clipboard softwares avaiable on the internet are versatile and have lot more options in general.
They are quite heavy in some cases and not everyone needs all the options that the software tools offers. 

This simple browser based tool is very lightweight and needs just a broswer window to operate. 
It uses local storage instead of any database software.

I am working on making it web-based so that the texts stored in the tool are saved directly to your own Google Drive or a similar platform.
